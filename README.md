# DnD-Stuff
A store of some of my cooler Blender assets from my DnD campaign.

Primarily just storing rigged character models from my campaign as I finish them. I had all of my players generate character models using [Hero Forge](https://www.heroforge.com/). From there, I was able to figure out how to get the assets into Blender. Once there, I rigged the characters and can now create fully-controlable animations with the characters!
